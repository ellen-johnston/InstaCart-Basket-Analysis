# InstaCart-Basket-Analysis
Files relating to the project completed for InstaCart using Python.

Instacart was wanting to uncover some trends and patterns within their sales data. They wanted to know which departments are most commonly ordered from, what time of day and day of the week orders are more frequently placed, and if certain demographics had different spending habits within the app. This information will be used to determine how they should place advertisements or what kind of deals should be put in place to increase revenue. Jupyter Notebook and Python were used to conduct this analysis.
